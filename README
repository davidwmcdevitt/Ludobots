Snakes are generated off of a DNA sequence that is randomly generated before the generate body/brain commands are called. DNA includes randomization of link dimensions AND joint type. Noticeable challenge of snakes falling into a "steady state" sleep where their sensor states don't vary in a manner that causes motion. In the video I submitted I had to give the snake a judge to walk.... but it walks nicely.
